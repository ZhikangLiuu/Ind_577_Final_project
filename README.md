# Final project for INDE 577 — Data Science and Machine Learning

### Student: Zhikang Liu

### Email: zl161@rice.edu

### Phone: 346-638-2999

### Purpose: 

### Stucture:

- **README.md**

- **Supervised Learning**:
    - Model Building and Error Analysis
    - Linear Regression
    - Gradient Descent
    - Logistic Regression
    - Neural Nets
    - Support Vector Machines
    - k-Nearest Neighbors
    - Decision/ Regression Trees
    - Ensemble Learning

- **Unsupervised Learning**:
    - k-Means Clustering
    - Principle Component Analysis


 

### Programming Language: 
This course relies heavily on programming, and the programming language of choice for many data scientists is python. As such, this course will be taught using  python, versions 3.6 and higher.

### Grading Policy: 
Each student will build a Github repository throughout the semester and this repository will be the only grading criteria for this course. The students repository will have sub-repositories which will contain data sets, descriptive README.md files, and Jupyter notebooks illustrating implementations of the algorithms covered in this course. At the end of the semester the instructor will view each students GitHub repository and assign course grades according to the following criteria:

* [70 points] Each algorithm covered in the course is successfully implemented on a dataset not used by the instructor during lecture.
* [10 points] Performance and error analysis is conducted on each algorithm.
* [10 points] Jupiter notebooks are clear and clean with code that has been written in a professional “pythonic” manor.
* [10 points] README files are included in each subdirectory clearly explaining the algorithm being implemented as well as explaining the data that it is being used.

Course grades will be assigned in the typical manor,  100 - 90 points (A), 89 - 80 points (B), 79 - 70 points (C), 69-60 points (D), 59 - 0 (F).
